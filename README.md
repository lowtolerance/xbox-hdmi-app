## About this Repository
The xbox-hdmi-app is an open-source homebrew application for the Original Xbox to allow basic control and firmware updating of the XboxHDMI mod by MakeMHz LLC. 

This is my own fork of Dustin Holden's original native Xbox app, which is a total fucking dumpster fire. And since LoveMHz has a grudge against me for exposing him as a convicted fraud, he is not currently accepting my pull requests.
